# Brute-Force Sorting

We talked about the complexity of the sorting problem, and used an argument over
all permutations of a list to be sorted to determine its complexity. Implement
a function to sort a list by systematically trying all permutations of the input
list, using the template in `code.js`. Test your new function; I've provided
some basic testing code that uses [jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in
`code.test.js`.

The return value should be the number of permutations that were tried until the
sorted list was "discovered". The unsorted list passed as an argument should be
sorted, i.e. do not copy the list and sort the copy.

## Runtime Analysis

What is the runtime complexity of the algorithm that you implemented? What does
a best case input for your implementation look like, what does a worst case
input look like? How would this complexity change if you generated permutations
randomly without memory instead of systematically trying them?

Describe your reasoning and the conclusion you've come to. Your reasoning is the
most important part. Add your answer to this markdown file.

The recursive call breaks the array in half each time so it will run at O(log n) times unless the pivot is the highest or lowest number then it would need to run through the array O(n) times. The for loop in the recursive call needs to go through every number so it would run n times. So you end up with O(nlog n) in the best case or O(n^2) in the worst case.
